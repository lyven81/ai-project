## 📖 Usage

### Database Structure

The agent works with **3 TinyDB tables**:

#### 1. **orders_tbl** (Read-Only)
Historical transaction data loaded from your CSV:
- Order_ID, Order_Date, Customer_Name
- Product details (Category, Product_Name, Price, Quantity)
- Revenue, Profit, Region, City, State

#### 2. **customers_tbl** (Read/Write - Starts Empty)
Customer profiles created by the agent:
- customer_id, customer_name
- total_orders, total_spent, total_profit_contributed
- average_order_value
- first_order_date, last_order_date, days_since_last_order
- favorite_category, segment, tags

#### 3. **campaigns_tbl** (Read/Write - Starts Empty)
Marketing campaigns designed by the agent:
- campaign_id, campaign_name
- target_segment, target_customer_count, target_customer_ids
- status (draft/active/completed), created_date

### Customer Segmentation Logic

The AI automatically categorizes customers:

| Segment | Criteria | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **VIP** | Total spent > $2,000 AND orders ≥ 5 | Premium rewards, exclusive offers |
| **Regular** | Total spent $500-$2,000 | Standard promotions, loyalty programs |
| **At-Risk** | Days since last order > 180 | Re-engagement campaigns |
| **New** | Total orders ≤ 2 | Welcome series, onboarding |
| **Churned** | Days since last order > 365 | Win-back campaigns |

### Sample Questions

```python
# Customer Intelligence
result = marketing_agent(
    "Who are our top 10 VIP customers by total spending? Show in bar chart",
    db=db,
    orders_tbl=orders_tbl,
    customers_tbl=customers_tbl,
    campaigns_tbl=campaigns_tbl,
)

# Segment Analysis
result = marketing_agent(
    "How many customers are in each segment (VIP, Regular, At-Risk, New, Churned)?",
    db=db, orders_tbl=orders_tbl,
    customers_tbl=customers_tbl,
    campaigns_tbl=campaigns_tbl,
)

# Campaign Creation
result = marketing_agent(
    "Create a holiday campaign targeting VIP customers who spent over $2000. Name it 'VIP Holiday Sale 2024'.",
    db=db, orders_tbl=orders_tbl,
    customers_tbl=customers_tbl,
    campaigns_tbl=campaigns_tbl,
)

# At-Risk Analysis
result = marketing_agent(
    "What is the average order value of at-risk segment customers?",
    db=db, orders_tbl=orders_tbl,
    customers_tbl=customers_tbl,
    campaigns_tbl=campaigns_tbl,
)

# Product Category Analysis
result = marketing_agent(
    "Which product category has the highest number of customers who spend below $1000?",
    db=db, orders_tbl=orders_tbl,
    customers_tbl=customers_tbl,
    campaigns_tbl=campaigns_tbl,
)
```

## 🤖 AI Capabilities

### Code Generation Intelligence

The agent understands complex business requirements and generates:

**1. TinyDB Queries**
```python
# Dynamic filtering with Query()
Item = Query()
vip_customers = customers_tbl.search(Item.segment == 'VIP')
at_risk_east = customers_tbl.search(
    (Item.segment == 'At-Risk') & (Item.region == 'East')
)
```

**2. RFM Calculations**
```python
# Automatic recency, frequency, monetary calculations
total_spent = sum(order['Revenue'] for order in customer_orders)
days_since = calculate_days_since(last_order_date)
segment = 'VIP' if total_spent > 2000 and total_orders >= 5 else 'Regular'
```

**3. Campaign Targeting**
```python
# Match customers to campaign criteria
target_ids = [c['customer_id'] for c in customers_tbl.search(criteria)]
campaigns_tbl.insert({
    'campaign_id': get_next_campaign_id(campaigns_tbl),
    'target_customer_ids': target_ids,
    'status': 'draft'
})
```

### Database Mutation Tracking

The agent shows **before/after snapshots** for transparency:
- Customers Table · Before execution
- Campaigns Table · Before execution
- ✅ Code execution with answer
- Customers Table · After execution (see new profiles)
- Campaigns Table · After execution (see new campaigns)
