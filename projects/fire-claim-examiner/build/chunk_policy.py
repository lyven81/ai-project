Fire Claim Examiner: Layer 1, the data layer.

Chunks the fire policy by DECISION NODE, not by page.

A decision node bundles everything needed to resolve one coverage question:
the base clause, the endorsement that overrides it, the causation triggers and
the excess formula. Chunking by page splits a clause from its own excess and
its own special conditions, which is precisely what makes similarity retrieval
return the wrong governing text.
