"""
Fire Claim Examiner: the deterministic calculator.

NO LANGUAGE MODEL TOUCHES THIS FILE. A figure an examiner puts on a claim file
cannot come from a token sampler. The model decides which rule applies; this
computes the number, in a fixed order, and prints its working.

Order of operations, and it is not negotiable:

    1. Exclusions          remove items the policy does not admit at all
    2. Condition of average applied PER SCHEDULE ITEM, never to the claim as a
                           whole (Condition 20: "Every item, if more than one,
                           of the Policy shall be separately subject to this
                           Condition")
    3. Excess              applied per endorsement group, after average
                           ("as ascertained after the application of any
                           condition of average")

Reversing steps 1 and 2 overstates the payable: on the bakery claim it gives
RM 70,875 on Item 2 instead of RM 57,000.
